1,,,Collaborative housing,
2,1,,Community housing,"(goal is to live together)"
3,1,,Collective self-provision,"(goal is to create user-defined (affordable) housing together)"
4,2,,Cohousing,"Cohousing encompasses intentional communities with a high degree of social interaction and social cohesion. They are formed by like-minded people whose main drivers are the creation of a community by sharing everyday life activities and, to some extent, sustainability and affordability. Cohousing projects often consist of self-contained units with common shared facilities. The kitchen with common dining room prevails as the most distinctive shared space that is used for collective cooking and dining on a regular basis. Along with the kitchen, cohousing projects may also have a wide variety of common facilities such as workshops, laundry rooms, playrooms for children, gardens, guestrooms, bicycle stores, or assembly rooms. The social organisation consists of  democratic self-governance and includes the formation of working groups or commissions to manage domestic tasks. Cohousing is based on mutual aid and support in day-to-day living. Whilst social and spatial organisation are distinctive common features, tenure and legal forms are diverse and change per country."
5,2,,Eco-villages,"Eco-villages are intentional communities that are primarily driven by the desire to maintain a natural, ecological, sustainable lifestyle and to produce the least possible negative impact on the natural environment. The social organisation of residents varies. The residents share ideological values, collective self-organisation and a high degree of cooperation, including an exchange of services in daily life while maintaining autonomy for each home. In some cases, it includes the organisation of working groups, focused on working the land or the forest. In terms of spatial organisation, the projects are mostly private and autonomous single-family houses (existing village houses) often organised around a common space, or shared rooms with a separate building for common use (e.g. collective kitchen, meetings). In some cases, these projects are self-build, located in low-density rural areas or, as in the Spanish case, the projects are located in abandoned country houses or villages, which often creates land ownership problems. These forms vary greatly in terms of tenure and legal form."
6,2,,Living Groups,"Living groups are developed by groups of like-minded people who share ideas and interests, such as affordability and community living. In some cases, its drivers also include aspects of sustainability, mutual care, shared responsibility, stability and security. These projects are spatially organised as shared apartments or private units with bedrooms and bathrooms complemented by shared spaces, such as kitchens and living rooms. The social organisation varies, as it may include family nuclei, couples and singles of different ages, which in some cases are organised in work groups to carry out daily tasks, in other cases residents also can participate in activities and housing assemblies. Rental is often the adopted housing tenure. Regarding its legal form, some cases are cooperatives, non-profit organisations or foundations, and associations."
7,3,,Collective self-development,"Collective self-development (or Building groups) encompasses housing initiatives whose design and construction process is initiated and led by the residents in collaboration with architects and other professionals. Affordability, self-provision, and innovation (i.e., new ways of providing housing) are the drivers that guide its development. In most cases, the housing projects are similar to cohousing in terms of spatial organisation, although with less emphasis on the common spaces and activities. Collaboration and sharing activities are more intense during the design and construction phases and less during the living phase. Homeownership is the most prominent tenure type. Residents usually organise through associations."
8,3,,Non-profit housing,"What binds these collaborative housing forms is primarily their non-profit character. They are more top-down than the other forms, as they are mainly rental housing initiated and led by public or social housing providers. Affordability, solidarity, and social (re)integration are the main drivers. The aim is to provide more autonomy and an active role to the residents in the housing management and maintenance. Housing projects may include collective spaces, although it is not an essential feature of this kind of collaborative housing forms. The focus is more on the collective self-management of the building."
9,3,,Housing cooperatives,"Housing cooperative is a ‘container' term to describe a particular legal form with historical and political roots. Old cooperatives are more conventional and with a lower degree of self-organisation, and ‘new cooperatives', which belong to a new generation of cooperatives, are usually smaller and often resident-led or at least with a high degree of collective self-organisation from the conception to the management of the building. Both types have affordability as one of the main drivers, while the new ones are also based on innovation, solidarity, and diversity. According to our baseline definition, old housing cooperatives without self-organisation do not fall under the umbrella of collaborative housing. Sub-forms of housing cooperatives are defined by tenure types and their profit/non-for-profit condition."
10,3,,Community Land Trusts,"Community Land Trusts (CLTs) are non-profit organisations that own the land on which homes are built on, on behalf of a community. They are driven by affordability, democracy and collaboration. Not necessarily self-organised, they can be initiated by an organisation or a developer. Generally, housing projects do not include more collective spaces than mainstream housing."
11,4,,Senior cohousing,"Senior cohousing is a well-established subform of cohousing, intended for people above 40-50 years old. The main driver is to create an environment to spend the older age. In this regard, common spaces and services are designed to promote autonomy among the elderly. The common spaces may include special facilities such as health and occupational therapy facilities, libraries or hairdressers. As with cohousing in general, committees and working groups are formed to manage domestic tasks but here can also include hired services for catering, cleaning or laundry."
12,9,,Rental cooperatives,"Subform where households pay a rent to the cooperative of renters, while the housing can be either owned by the same cooperative, a municipal company or private provider."
13,9,,Ownership/shared equity cooperatives,"Subform where households purchase a ‘share' of the cooperative. Each member of the cooperative receives the right to live in a housing unit, as well as a vote on matters of common interest. Cooperative members share responsibility in the management and administration of the building."
